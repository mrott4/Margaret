<h4>Student: Margaret Rott</h4>
<p>I learned many new things in the Learning to Code I class. Here are are some of the highlights.</p>
<!-- This is the beginning of an unordered list using both HTML and  CSS. -->
<style>ul.b {
  list-style-type: square;}
</style>
<ul class="b">
<li> Coding is like using an alphabet to write, except you're using the unique set of characters and
<br> syntax of a given programming language.</li><br>
<li> All documents that appear in a web browser have at least the following three Hypertext
<br> Markup Language (HTML) elements: &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;, &lt;html&gt;-&lt;/html&gt; and &lt;body&gt;-
<br>&lt;/body&gt;. These elements provide the basic structure for the browser content.</li><br>
<li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) tell the browser how to display the content. For example, CSS
<br> can be coded for the background color, the font family, or a list format.</li><br>
<li>This class reinforced the importance of setting goals and tracking achievements. Each week
<br> we reported our objectives and outcomes for the day in a pull request on GitHub, a system for
<br> managing software development. </li><br>
<li>Adding comments to code and GitHub pull requests can provide valuable information about
<br> why the coding was done as it was.</li><br>
<li>My Meetup with the Women Who Code East Bay-Programming and Web Development was
<br> cancelled. In lieu of this meetup, I listened to a recording of a recent meeting of the Silicon
<br> Valley Chapter of the Society for Technical Communication. The speaker was from Microsoft
<br> and spoke on open-source systems, GitHub in particular. He made the point that in the current
<br> <i>agile</i> environment, technical writers are hired first for their technical expertise and 
<br>secondarily for their writing ability. It is assumed, in fact, that all staff have at least some
<br>writing skill, but their technical expertise is what really counts.</ul>
<p>As our Learning to Code I class comes to a close, I don't know if I'll be able to continue with a
<br> class next term. I do know that there will be more coding in my future, whether in the classroom
<br> or on my own, or who knows - maybe on the job! Thank you, San Leandro Adult School and
<br> especially our instructor Lisa Rose, for a very worthwhile experience.
